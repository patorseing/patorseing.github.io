        Before I studied in university, I thought I was below the standard. And,
        I never thought that I would not see success in anything. But I studied
        hard and harder in my passion for technology and data. My clicking point
        was when I applied to the Faculty of Information and Communication
        Technology, Mahidol University; My GPA was much better than high school.
        That made me know that this may be the right way to be my career and
        life. So now, I also keep improving and expanding to other sides too. ðŸ˜‰
